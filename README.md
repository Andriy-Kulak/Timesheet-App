<h3><b>Name: Timesheet App</b></h3>
<br/>
Main Technologies Used: React, Redux, Node, PostgreSQL
<br/>
Description: the app helps users keep track of their daily working hours. In addtion, I will be building out dashboard that does analytics on the data.

<h4>To Do List</h4>
Step 1:
- √ - build authentication with email or facebook
- √ - use the name logged by user to store that as a reference when s/he creates a new timesheet entry
- √ - change api so when we hit ... api/v1/timesheet/{userID} - it brings a list of all the entries for that user
Step 2:
- finishe configuring user detail with api
- add another table that has the options for types of work available
- create a dynamic submition form where a user can submit multiple days at the same timesheet
- unit testing for both front and back end
Step 3:
- create a dashboard for specific user where s/he sees their logged timesheet
- create D3 dashboard where the user can see statistics of what's going on
